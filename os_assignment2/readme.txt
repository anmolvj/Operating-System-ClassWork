An estranged family finds redemption in the unlikeliest of places: the 
MMA ring. Tommy (Tom Hardy), an ex-Marine with a tragic past, returns home and 
enlists his father (Nick Nolte), a recovering alcoholic and former wrestling coach,
 to train him for "Sparta," the biggest MMA tournament ever held. But when Tommy's underdog 
 brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), fights his way into the tournament, 
the two brothers must finally confront each other and the forces that pulled them apart.
