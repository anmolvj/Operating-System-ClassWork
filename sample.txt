A Turing machine is an abstract machine[1] that manipulates symbols
on a strip of tape according to a table of rules; to be more exact, it
is a mathematical model of computation that defines such a device. Despite
the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine can be 
constructed that is capable of simulating that algorithm's logic.
